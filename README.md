# Hello and Welcome

Welcome to the innards of [my website](http://www.leehuishiung.site).


## Installation

If you want to run this site locally:

- just `git clone` it somewhere


## Who This Repo is For

This repo is mostly for me. I, like many of you, host my code on [GitHub](https://github.com) for reasons of portability, ease of work, and peace of mind. Beyond my own needs, I have also open-sourced this repo for you, the reader (and most likely developer), to explore the things that make my site tick.
